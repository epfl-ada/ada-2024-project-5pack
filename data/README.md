# Data folder

Put all the Wikispeedia data in this folder.

Once setup this folder should contain the following structure.
```
.
├── 📁 plaintext_articles
├── 📁 wikispeedia_paths-and-graph
├── 📁 wpcd
└── README.md
```

For Linux and macOS users, you can quickly configure this folder by executing the following code, assuming you have [curl](https://curl.se) and [tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/) installed on your system:
```bash
bash download_linux_or_macos.sh
```

## Generated data

This directory is also used to store data generated for the project in the different scripts. It allows to avoid some lengthy processes to run at each execution of the code.
