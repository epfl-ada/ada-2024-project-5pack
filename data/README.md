# Data folder

Put all the Wikispeedia data in this folder.

Once setup this folder should contain the following structure.
```
.
├── 📁 plaintext_articles
├── 📁 wikispeedia_paths-and-graph
├── 📁 wpcd
└── README.md
```

For Linux and macOS users, you can quickly configure this folder by executing the following code, assuming you have [curl](https://curl.se) and [tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/) installed on your system:
```bash
bash download_linux_or_macos.sh
```
